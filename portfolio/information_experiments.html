      <h5 class="main_title dark_font">Knowledge inside the computer</h5>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">What we know and know how to do is not completely contained in our heads. Cognitive performance relies on team members, reference books, quick guides, tools, and other resources. Team members specialize with diverse know-how and through coordination solve complex problems. The eyes of a rally car driver pummel the dirt road with intense gaze. The navigator shouts geometry about road conditions and instructs the driver's action. Reference books store comprehensive information. A psychologist filters through the pages of theory and case studies to help a client. Quick guides enable heuristics for simple action. I view statistical guides about my hands in card games—surely these cards will beat my opponent. Tools  off-load cognitive burden. Tracking software in sports and games afford new patterns of thinking and analysis—do my plays  show a deceptive weakness?</p>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">Knowledge and capability exist on a continuum, from the individual to the networks of people and objects. In some examples, technology plays an obvious role, but how much further can we push the boundaries of technical wonder?</p>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font"><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/107n1twib3zlrnb/Bush%20-%20As%20We%20May%20Think%20%28Life%20Magazine%209-10-1945%29.pdf?dl=0">As we may think</a>—written in 1945—is a proposition about the future of technology and the world to be. In this article, Vannevar Bush envisioned the Memex—a powerful device contained within the form of a work desk. On micro film, the Memex stored books, writings, records, and communications. All Memex entries could be accessed and light-projected onto a viewing area with remarkable speed and flexibility. A user could take and associate personal notes on collected work and share knowledge with colleagues. The Memex was the primitive  desktop computer.</p>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">Increasingly intimate and connected storage devices surround us—computers, phones, watches, sensory systems, and clouds. The exploration and advancement of technical hardware is not debatable—this is what a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/3l18hv/5_mb_harddrive_being_shipped_by_ibm_1956/">5MB hard drive looked like</a>. While also seeing advancements, software has not had the same scale of growth. Software mirrors hardware in form and function—rigorous rules resolving algorithmic state transitions—lacking an essential dynamic and emergent quality of human action.</p>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">In a vacuum, software is awesome and accomplishes phenomenal work. But when assisting humans in cognitive practices, software does not represent the same magnitude of growth as hardware. Early tech authors describe a future of cognitively enhanced humans with extraordinary command of information. We have some of that dream, but how much further can we go to augment cognition:</p>

      <h5 class="content_title dark_font">Purpose of my work</h5>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">People  perpetually build, access, and share information. Experts are needed to design systems that afford navigation of information seas and help communities of knowledge flourish. In developing my own expertise, I have experimented with information concepts to focus my thoughts about storage, retrieval, and interaction.</p>

    <!--description of creative direction-->
    <section class="content white_texture dark_font">
      <h5 class="content_title dark_font">One archive to rule them all... <br>and in the darkness bind them</h5>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font"><a href="https://nicholaspersa.github.io/tldrarchive/">TLDR Archive</a> is a basic extension of my cognition and represents my core idea for the future. Currently, the program is a repository for my academic readings. Unlike a traditional file structure, I can access all of my files from one perspective, search through superficial tags, dive deeply into each resource, and visualize information across different dimensions. The experience of the system is designed to be open, with knowledge living on one plane. My most relevant information is the most accessible, but connections to irrelevant data are still possible—like cognition.</p>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">TLDR organizes large bodies of personal knowledge for reference  by myself and others. I need access to this information when conducting and writing research. I rely on it for memory, carrying conversations, and organizing connections between things I have read. I can traverse subject areas and organize related content in short order. Beyond my own benefit, TLDR is a gateway for young professionals who need to learn about my domain knowledge in order to develop their own specializations.</p>

    <section class="content white_texture dark_font">
      <h5 class="content_title dark_font">Outline of projects</h5>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">Digital-human cognitive extension is complex. I have designed and built three projects to explore the topic.<br><br><em>[Click titles below to view live sites]</em></p>

      <h6 class="sub_content_title dark_font"><a href="https://nicholaspersa.github.io/tldrarchive/">TLDR Archive</a></h6>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">The first completed project in the series. The design goal achieved a uni-level platform for viewing, accessing, and searching stored files. All stored files are text-based documents. Each file has a title, tag, relevance weighting, and category. Associations can be made in the platform by these data attributes. This system connects to a back end program—Quip. Quip allows additional filtering through files by keywords. Keyword searches help  view related work and retrieve information as connected units.</p>

      <h6 class="sub_content_title dark_font"><a href="https://nicholaspersa.github.io/markbrowngmt/">GameMakers Toolkit</a></h6>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">A contrasting information scheme to the file visualizer. This archive system dismantled video-based content into chunks of information. Rather than a uni-level platform, data is organized into categories. Inside of a category are knowledge chunks. Each chunk provides a short description and links to the relevant location in the associated video. When viewing an individual chunk, a side-scrolling window contains the other related chunks from that section. The core design is to provide another means to access and interact with video based knowledge. This deconstruction into textual chunks affords searching through the content in a way traditional video lacks.</p>

      <h6 class="sub_content_title dark_font"><a href="https://nicholaspersa.github.io/eduframeworks/index.html">Designing Curriculum Primer</a></h6>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">This is a written paper transformed into a digital experience. As new means to share and interact with stored files become possible, there is little sense in leaving the file formats untouched. This work is preliminary, lacking a deep exploration of associations and mechanics possible in a digital context. The project's low-fidelity scope encourages discussion for what could be.</p>

    </section>

    <!--design concerns-->
    <section class="content white_texture dark_font">
      <h5 class="content_title dark_font">Design concerns</h5>

      <h6 class="sub_content_title dark_font">File Storage</h6>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">File organization follows a deep tree hierarchy—a file in a folder in a folder in a folder. Storing files in this way makes accessing them a complex activity that requires attention, memory, time, and sequences of physical input. The practice of file storage is similar to the idea  of “deep links.” In web design, important content can require navigating multiple interfaces to find the needed information—a deep link.</p>

      <h6 class="sub_content_title dark_font">File Access</h6>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">There is the actual opening of a file, and then there is the human driven experience of reading and using a file. Access is more than opening, but  interacting with something. Content that is stored deep in a hierarchy is hardly accessible. When content is desired, a user needs to trail-blaze to the location of the file. Physically clicking through  content areas to find relevant information is a cognitive nightmare. Needing to remember a file name and search an ENTIRE computer is also not optimal.</p>

      <h6 class="sub_content_title dark_font">Associative Interactions</h6>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font"> Files are created without connections and links to other files. If a file in linked to another, it does not allow for connection to specific parts of the file. Even if some connections are allowed, they are unidimensional and do not enable a document to establish a network of connections to specific locations in other files. The contents of files  remain pure entities that cannot be blended and hybridized.</p>

      <h6 class="sub_content_title dark_font">Associative Access</h6>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">A file's relationship is defined by the containing folder, and the containing folder of that folder. When you access a file, it is a single action with a single result. The steps of the activity do not represent deep understandings and relationships with an array of information. Over time, stored files should develop contextualized properties.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content white_texture dark_font">
      <h5 class="content_title dark_font">Design Goals</h5>

      <h6 class="sub_content_title dark_font">Interface</h6>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font"> A single interface separates the user from the stored information. Search tools provide an immediate filter to locate files and visually connect them to surrounding information. Files are not concrete, but allow the user to add data properties and adjust them on-demand. The design of the data attributes creates the organizational structure for the files. As a file develops a context, an organization around the file emerges.</p>

      <h6 class="sub_content_title dark_font">Cognitive Extension</h6>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">I do not dream that I can use my eyes and thoughts to dig through tree hierarchies, open a single item, dig through that, fail to find what I need, close the opened item, and start all over in a different location. I dream that I wont have to—I can think of a location in a field of information and quickly find a networked constellation of relevant data.</p>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">There is no need to dig or click-through, there is only the need to think once and be at a target area. Once there, the information is not single access in cascading documents, but on a common field where different criteria cycle through various constellations of the content. I find what I need not by elimination and brute force, but by using associative inquiry. The more visited the networks and content, the faster and more accessible the content is—akin to cognition.</p>

      <h6 class="sub_content_title dark_font">Community Access</h6>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">Communities of people working to learn and share information can be  diffuse and abstract. Information varies in quality and a plethora of data is lost in translation. Digital knowledge access and development is a next step in human cognition and learning. Curated digital content needs to be networked to remain valuable and viable. Not only does a networked model benefit individual cognition, but the network stands to teach others what they need to learn to be in a similar profession.</p>

      <h6 class="sub_content_title dark_font">Community Interaction</h6>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">Connecting with other content curators and networks of information improves the direction and content of all parties. Staying afloat in today's information sea is a huge demand and a mystery. Organizing peers within a common system changes accessibility and creates a potential for new systems to develop.</p>

      <h6 class="sub_content_title dark_font">TLDR Archive</h6>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">Everything is here, it's like my brain leaked onto the web. When I am talking with colleagues and writing papers. I come here and look through content,  going deeper when I need more information. At the top level, I can skim around all that I know. Other times, I want to look in a specific domain, so I filter by section. To visually differentiate the files, I can highlight them by primary tag—every tag has a different color. Clicking on a file opens up the document, where I can read the content and perform keyword searches.</p>

      <h6 class="sub_content_title dark_font">GameMaker's Toolkit</h6>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">After watching hours of video, designers can reference the GMT catalogue to quickly find and understand previous information. All of the content is linked to the original videos, so the original context is available on demand. GMT video content is  broken into categorizable chunks, so patterns and relationships in the videos can be mapped out and organized. The chunk format makes it feasible to jump around domains of knowledge that the videos cover without needing to bookmark individual time stamps.</p>

    <section class="content white_texture dark_font">
      <h5 class="content_title dark_font">The Post Mortem</h5>
      <h6 class="sub_content_title dark_font">File Storage & Access</h6>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">TLDR is clean and quickly traversed during search operations. Diving into file content is equally simple. The powerful Quip backend affords complex search queries on the content inside of files, rather than only on titles or surface tags. TLDR can be accessed on any web connected device by any user. GameMaker's Toolkit is valuable, but not needed by my work routines. I have little sense of the interaction experience. However, as a game developer I can see value in breaking down information and being able to reference it later.</p>
      <h6 class="sub_content_title dark_font">Associative Interaction & Access</h6>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">TLDR color tags provide less information about the relationships between files. While it is interesting, the structure of the content remains the same. When tags are active, the viewport of the files is relatively small and only side by side comparisons can be made. Zooming out and seeing larger connections may be more informative. Currently, hovering over any file has no action, but could pull related files closer, like a magnet. Perhaps this can be an additional button or feature. This activity is afforded by the Quip word search, but occurs deeper in the system UI. A top level ability to make and view connections between files might be useful.</p>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">GameMaker's Toolkit there are not interactions currently featured. A search function may help quickly find patterns in the stored information. There is a prototype favorite ability, but storing favorites and navigating a growing database are not comparable. Chunk items are static, an option to change how the files are organized could improve long term curation. For example, a chunk in Level Techniques makes more sense in Design Concepts. An open voting system could be implemented for where  chunk belong, and would base the system organization on the majority perspective.</p>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">Designing Curriculum Primer remains a low-fidelity experience. One concept was to allow a reader to compare paragraph sections across the different content. Since the program represents six frameworks for thinking, a reader might see how the frameworks differ on definitions and use cases. Such a feature would make visual comparison a standard reading experience, rather than off-loading that task completely on the reader.</p>
      <h6 class="sub_content_title dark_font">Cognitive Extension</h6>
      <p class="content_paragraph dark_font">TLDR supplements what I know, and how efficiently I can synthesize information. The largest draw back is that I need to focus on controlling a UI on a device. This constraint is common across technology, which makes augmented reality and headset technology exciting. Visually accessing TLDR with minimal device engagement gets me closer to “plugging a USB drive into my head.”</p>
