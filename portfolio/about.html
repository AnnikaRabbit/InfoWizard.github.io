    <p class="content_paragraph">Hey, I'm Nicholas</p>
    <p class="content_paragraph">I am super duper passionate about information in the digital world. I am currently working towards a PhD in gamification studies. My research explains how and why game mechanics lead to certain user outcomes. So in education games, a relevant topic is how questing mechanics impact student learning.</p>
    <p class="content_paragraph">Do students fully explore what is available through quests? Does an open and free choice increase engagement with material? How do teachers and peers affect someone's quest selections? What kinds of difficulty should quests use? Gameplay is a complex activity, and through theory building and analysis, I can help support better designs in gamification.</p>
    <p class="content_paragraph">My motivation for this type of work is to change the world. Oh the dreams of grandeur, but it's just who I tend to be. Growing up, I experienced many walks of life. I grew up in a middle class suburb. My family was low income.</p>
    <p class="content_paragraph">My mother is a lunch lady lifer, and my father has been on disability as far back as I can remember. Among my neighbors, I was an outsider. I drifted across the social spectrum searching for my place in the world. A rather dramatic story best shared over many light dinners, I came to see a world in need.</p>
    <p class="content_paragraph">So many people struggle and end up without help and support. So many don't reach for dreams, as they were never allowed to have them. As with any passing era, there is another powerful tool to upend the status quo. Technology can reach and affect so many people, and power-lift the powerless up out this towering inferno.</p>
    <p class="content_paragraph">My passion is to be a difference.</p>
    <p class="content_paragraph">I am currently working out of Irvine, California.</p>
