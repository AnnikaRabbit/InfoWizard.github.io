      <p>Hey</p>
      <p>I am Nicholas. I am a big foodie. On the up & up, fresh prepared <a href="http://www.forequartermadison.com/" target="_blank">food served in style</a> is my go to experience. Late night and running on low on those money units, ramen is to die for. Of course you need to sprinkle in a <a href="http://www.greenbushbakery.com/" target="_blank">doughnut</a> or dozen to make the soul sing. And in some other dimension, my doppelganger’s blood must be made of <a href="https://www.tazachocolate.com/" target="_blank">chocolate</a>—my craving for it is other worldly. You get the picture.</p>
      <p>Besides food, I don’t really have many favorite things. The problem is that I enjoy quite a lot. Is that a problem? I guess you could say I do certain things more than others, and I have plenty of preferences. But I am not hard fastened to anything in particular. At my heart I am an explorer, so if I had to say that one thing is my favorite—it’s uncertainty.</p>
      <p>Looking back at the work in my portfolio feels good. I have been working my passions. I have had some cool experiences and built some interesting things, but they have been small scale. I want to tackle larger projects, work with brilliant colleagues, and create impact. I have had a bit of an unconventional start, so there is one quote I keep around for motivation.</p>
      <p class="qoute">Sometimes the people with the greatest potential often take the longest to find their path because their sensitivity is a double edged sword—it lives at the heart of their brilliance, but it also makes them more susceptible to life’s pains. <span class="content_accent middle">Good thing we aren’t being penalized for handing in our purpose late.</span> The soul doesn’t know a thing about deadlines. -Jeff Brown.</p>
      <p>To me this sounds egotistical. Who am I to say that I am brilliant? Or have great potential? I think that stems from my own experiences with self-esteem and confidence. It is hard to identify and think of myself as any greatest. But I have come to terms with this. I have grown into a mindset that my value is determined by how my work moves others, not how it makes me feel. I want to see they way my work is great, and that will make me happy.</p>
      <p>There is one more quote I keep around.</p>
      <p class="qoute">Writers and people who had command of words were respected and feared as people who manipulated magic. In latter times, I think artists and writers have allowed themselves to be sold down the river. They have accepted the prevailing belief that art and writing are merely forms of entertainment.</p>
      <p class="qoute">They’re not seen as transformative forces that can change a human being, that can change a society. <span class="content_accent trailing">They are seen as simple entertainment—things with which we can fill twenty minutes, half an hour, while we’re waiting to die.</span></p>
      <p class="qoute">It is not the job of the artists to give the audience what they audience want. If the audience knew what they needed, they wouldn’t be the audience, they would be the artists. It is the job of the artists to give the audience what they need. -Alan Moore.</p>
