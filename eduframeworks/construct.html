            <p>The constructionist perspective is about empowering students to form their
              own conclusions by creatively experimenting and making objects in social
              channels. In such an environment, a teacher acts more as a guide and mentor,
              helping students understand hands-on while pursuing goals. What this learning
              theory takes advantage of is personal relevance. In this learn-by-<strong>you</strong>-making
              context, students are able to participate in an action that directly relates to
              their core motivations. A result of such a connection: students can experience
              high engagement and activity while learning.</p>
              <p class="additionalParagraph">A stark example is that of an art class, where students
                invest their time and attention to carve and shape forms however they fancy.
                The other is that of a math class, where unitized problems are done (or not done)
                in succession; such work is not often associated with high student investment or
                creative processes (Papert, 1991). The purpose is not to turn math into art, but
                rather to see the construction themed work learners do and bring that into math.
                This is exemplified by a student (5th grade) that programmed a series of graphics
                in a software program called LogoWriter. The student explained that he had to
                build angles and curvatures to make his work “graceful,” but it also consequently
                became an activity of high interest that impacted the learning outcomes.</p>
            <img id="header-why-important" class="headerBadges" src="assets/header-why-important.png" alt=""/>
            <p>The view of education from a student's perspective can fundamentally shift just how
              much effort that student invests. From this concept, most learning theories address
              how to motivate and engage students for a reason: in traditional learning, students are
              not investing themselves. The advantage of constructionism is that the student becomes
              an important member in whatever they are learning. Students are actively working to
              understand themselves and what they know, with the support of teachers and other students.
              This learning theory replaces the “teach at” mentality to an “assist to understand” model
              (Papert, 1991). An implication of this theory is that the making tends to be collaborative
              and results in students practicing epistemological pluralism (i.e., there is more than one
              way to accomplish and demonstrate learning).</p>

            <div class="subSpacer"></div>
            <p>Students need to dive into situations where they can make and test their
              understandings. The activity design should close the distance between
              “teaching theory” to “practicing theory.” By letting students become
              one with their content under study can be a powerful and connected
              experience. The activity can: (1) test students ideas, (2) consider
              alternate pathways, and (3) adjust, stretch and expand their understandings
              (Papert, 1991). The root design is not necessarily that students produce
              some artifact, but rather how they make and produce the artifact.</p>

            <img class="subHeaderBadges" src="assets/subheader-const-2.png" alt=""/>
            <div class="subSpacer"></div>
            <p>There are many cases in traditional education where students “make”
              things: presentations, papers, posters, models, worksheets, and so
              on. What constructionism idolizes is the underlying reason why
              students are making—the audience or purpose. One strong purpose
              can be making for the student's own interest: they are making it
              for themselves. When building and programming a robotic vehicle with
              LEGO, a student ran into a mistake (i.e. a bug) where the vehicle
              vibrated across the ground instead of rolling with wheels  (Resnick &amp; Ocko, 1990).
              The student decided to use to the bug of vibration as the movement mechanism.
              The nature of the purpose and audience allowed the student to direct the
              project to align with their perspective, rather than to a stifling or artificial purpose.</p>
              <p class="additionalParagraph">However, internal purpose is not the only way
                to establish such a strong conviction. A similar building project may
                frame the work as to solve a larger problem, perhaps to make the most
                efficient vehicle for a race. In higher education, students who
                participate in building solar vehicles or fuel efficient race cars
                demonstrate making for an external audience or purpose—engineering
                feats in automotive design or competition for social reward and
                recognition. A final form of an external audience/purpose may
                involve interacting with experts during class learning: learning
                about cooking when a chef comes to teach baking, modeling systems
                after a nurse comes to discuss healthcare, making a game after
                talking with designers and programmers (Bonk, TV Relevance). The
                objective of this component is to connect what students are making
                to a real and authentic purpose, and overcome the isolated state of
                learning contexts in traditional learning (Papert, 1991).</p>

            <p>Students need the right support while they journey through a making experience.
              Feedback is a critical aspect to success in their endeavors. The feedback can come
              from peers who help students reflect on their understandings as well as guiding
              directions from an instructor. The timing and amount of the feedback needs to
              support the student as they hit difficulties and overcome challenges.</p>
              <p class="additionalParagraph">Having concrete learning goals can also
                help the student direct their efforts. While the intent is not to
                impose a learning goal on a student's perspective, the approaches
                available to students should help them understand how to move
                forward with their work. In the example above with LEGO, some
                students built traditional vehicles while others built moving
                sculptures (Resnick &amp; Ocko, 1990). However, each student
                was able to begin from a “region of comfort” and explore how
                their interest met the learning goals of the LEGO activity.</p>
              <p class="additionalParagraph">The final support is establishing a design
                that values literacy of facts. The idea is that a student can speak in
                the language of the domain; applying and using the knowledge in a
                meaningful way. If students spend time memorizing facts for evaluation, it
                can (1) undermine their abilities to retrieve knowledge in the future and (2)
                provide a weaker base of understanding for future learning.</p>
