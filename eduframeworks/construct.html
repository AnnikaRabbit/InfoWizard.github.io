            <p>The constructionist perspective is about empowering students to form their
              own conclusions by creatively experimenting and making objects while in a social
              medium. In such an environment, a teacher acts more as a guide and mentor,
              helping students understand hands-on while they pursue their goals. What this learning
              theory takes advantage of is personal relevance. In this "learn-by-<strong>you</strong>-making
              context," students are able to participate in an action that directly relates to
              their core motivations. A result of such a connection: students can experience
              high engagement and activity while learning.</p>
              <p class="additionalParagraph">A stark example is that of an art class, where students
                invest their time and attention to carve and shape forms however they fancy.
                The opposite is that of a traditional math class, where unitized problems are done (or not done)
                in succession; such work is <strong>not</strong> often associated with high student investment or
                creative processes <span class="citation" data-article=2 >[2]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>. The purpose is not to turn math into art, but
                rather to see how construction themed work can be undertaken in math.
                This is exemplified by a student (5th grade) that programmed a series of graphics
                in a software program called LogoWriter. The student explained that he had to
                build angles and curvatures to make his work “graceful,” but it also consequently
                became an activity of high interest that impacted the learning outcomes.</p>
            <img id="header-why-important" class="headerBadges" src="assets/header-why-important.png" alt=""/>
            <p>The view of education from a student's perspective can fundamentally shift just how
              much effort that student invests. Along with constructionism, most learning theories address
              how to motivate and engage students for a reason: in traditional learning, students are
              not investing themselves. The advantage of constructionism is that the student becomes
              an important member in whatever they are learning. Students are actively working to
              understand themselves and what they know, with the support of teachers and other students.
              This learning theory replaces the “teach at” mentality to an “assist to understand” model
              <span class="citation" data-article=2 >[2]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>. An implication of this theory is that the making of knowledge tends to be collaborative
              and results in students practicing epistemological pluralism (i.e., there is more than one
              way to accomplish and demonstrate learning).</p>

            <img id="header-how-used" class="headerBadges" src="assets/header-how-used.png" alt=""/>
            <img class="subHeaderBadges" src="assets/subheader-const-1.png" alt=""/>
            <div class="subSpacer"></div>
            <p>Students need to dive into situations where they can make and test their
              understandings. The activity design should close the distance between
              “teaching theory” and “practicing theory.” By letting students become
              one with the content under study, they can have a powerful and connected
              learning experience. The activity needs to: (1) test students ideas, (2) allow and highlight
              alternate pathways, and (3) adjust, stretch and expand their understandings
              <span class="citation" data-article=2 >[2]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>.
              The root design is not necessarily that students produce
              some artifact, but rather how they are allowed to make and produce the artifact.
            If the student is not actively testing their current undestandings, then they are not "making" but following steps.</p>

            <img class="subHeaderBadges" src="assets/subheader-const-2.png" alt=""/>
            <div class="subSpacer"></div>
            <p>There are many cases in traditional education where students “make”
              things: presentations, papers, posters, models, worksheets, and so
              on. What constructionism idolizes is the underlying reason why
              students are making—the audience or purpose. One strong purpose
              can be making for the student's own interest: they are making it
              for themselves. For example, when building and programming a robotic vehicle with
              LEGO, a student might run into a mistake (i.e. a bug) where the vehicle
              vibrates across the ground instead of rolling with wheels <span class="citation" data-article=3 >[3]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>.
              The student could decide to use the buggy vibration as the movement mechanism.
              The nature of the purpose and audience helps the student direct their learning
               to align with their perspective, rather than to a stifling or artificial purpose.</p>
              <p class="additionalParagraph">However, internal purpose is not the only way
                to establish a strong conviction. A similar building project may
                frame the work as to solve a larger problem, perhaps to make the most
                efficient vehicle for a race. In higher education, students who
                participate in building solar vehicles or fuel efficient race cars
                demonstrate making for an external audience or purpose—engineering
                feats in automotive design or competition for social reward and
                recognition. A final form of an external audience/purpose may
                involve interacting with experts during class learning: learning
                about cooking when a chef comes to teach baking, modeling systems
                after a nurse comes to discuss healthcare, making a game after
                talking with designers and programmers <span class="citation" data-article=1 >[1]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>. The
                objective of this component is to connect what students are making
                to a real and authentic purpose, and overcome the isolated state of
                learning contexts in traditional learning <span class="citation" data-article=2 >[2]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>.</p>

            <img class="subHeaderBadges" src="assets/subheader-const-3.png" alt=""/>
            <div class="subSpacer"></div>
            <p>Students need the right support while they journey through a making experience.
              Feedback is a critical aspect to success in their endeavors. The feedback can come
              from peers who help students reflect on their understandings, as well as guiding
              directions from an instructor. The timing and amount of the feedback needs to
              support the student as they hit difficulties and overcome challenges.</p>
              <p class="additionalParagraph">Having concrete learning goals can also
                help the student direct their efforts. While the intent is not to
                impose a learning goal on a student's perspective, the approaches
                available in the learning environment should help a student understand how to move
                forward with their work. In the example above with LEGO, some
                students built traditional vehicles while others built moving
                sculptures <span class="citation" data-article=3 >[3]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>. However, each student
                was able to begin from a “region of comfort” and explore how
                their interest met the learning goals of the LEGO activity.</p>
              <p class="additionalParagraph">The final support is establishing a design
                that values literacy of facts. The idea is that a student can speak in
                the language of the domain; applying and using knowledge in a
                meaningful way. If students spend time memorizing facts for evaluation, it
                can (1) undermine their abilities to retrieve knowledge in the future and (2)
                provide a weaker base of understanding for future learning.</p>

                <img id="header-why-important" class="headerBadges" src="assets/header-what-look.png" alt="" />
                <p>When a student makes, it is crucial that they are building on their knowledge and challenging their current ways of knowing.
                So if the task is to make a solar system, there is little value in learning how to make spherical objects. The student
                should work to understand how a solar system functions, or how to make interesting configurings that might exist in the universe.
                In authentic making, there is something at risk, the chance that what the student makes fails to represent some complex domain of knowledge.
                The power is in when the thing made connects to this domain of knowledge; the student learns vicariously through their creation as it reveals the
                underlying relationships of that domain.
              </p>
                <img class="storyImage" src="assets/con-making.png" alt="" />
                <p>With a real thing to make and learn from, students need that rich reason why they are making in the first place.
                Perhaps they are asked to plan an exploration in space, or they are curious about space exploration intrinsically. The making of something
              in this "space explorer" context needs to follow certain rules in order to achieve a successful mission, which relates to many professions in society (e.g., aerodynamics, NASA, innovation in technonlogy, etc.).
            The purpose can also be rooted in being able to make and understand solar sytems (i.e., astrophysics and astronomy). In this latter purpose, the
          focus can be on documenting and reporting phenomena in a workbook, or discussing with experts their developing knowledge.</p>
                <img class="storyImage" src="assets/con-purpose.png" alt="" />
                <p>In such open learning experiences, students will need some help to stay on track and challenge their knowledge to make progress.
                This kind of support can come from the experience itself or from peers and instructors. The purpose of this support is enable the student
              to transition from basic understandings to being able to apply complex actions in the domain. So in line with a mission of space exploration,
            a student could be challenged and supported to understand velocities and flight paths in order to move from planet to planet&mdash;functional knowledge.</p>
