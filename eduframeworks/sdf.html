            <p>Scaffolding design framework (SDF) is a comprehensive synthesis of various models
              of science inquiry practice and general learning theory (Quintana et al, 2009).
              Among the models condensed into SDF are the LfU and SKIF frameworks. The purpose
              of SDF is as a theoretical framework for inquiry that can be examined empirically
              to highlight what approaches to scaffolding work best for learners across contexts.
              SDF is broken down into three high-level elements: task model, obstacles, and scaffolding
              guidelines (Quintana, 2009). Task model describes types of inquiry contrived from existing
              literature, obstacles are what learners encounter while using a type of task model, and the
              third element is a collection of scaffolding guidelines that describe how task model types
              can be modified to help learners pass obstacles.</p>

            <p>SDF represents an amalgamation of various inquiry methods and theories of learning. As each
              of the constituent parts address specific concerns and design challenges; an assortment
              of them provides a robust framework to base future learning design on. SDF creates common
              ground for the other frameworks and allows learning contexts to be compared and studied.
              SDF by its nature, is also an attempt to extract the underlying workings from other
              theories and their models of learning. The high-level insight proposed by SDF can
              help guide new theory and development across multiple domains.</p>

            <p>Sense making describes the very nature of how basic actions are done by students
              practicing scientific inquiry: forming hypotheses, designing and carrying out
              experiments, analyzing data, and understanding what was done. The purpose is
              to make sense with the rigor of a scientist—a systematic and operationalized
              activity embodying the rules and regulations of the respective field (e.g.,
              only varying one aspect at a time, testing hypothesis with experimental cases,
              etc.). Through the design of the activity, students learn from the actions and
              sequences they engage with: manipulating representations, elucidating patterns,
              and identifying objects and problems.</p>
              <p><strong>Obstacles</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Learners need help when connecting their existing knowledge to that of the formal discipline (Edelson, Gordin, &amp; Pea, 1999)</li>
              <li>Students do not have the domain specific knowledge to cue in to the most relevant information</li>
              <li>Learning the expert strategies to guide sense making are not typically salient (Collins &amp; Brown, 1988; Collins, Brown, &amp; Newman, 1989a; Merrill, Reiser, Ranney, &amp; Trafton, 1992)</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Guidlines</strong></p>

            <div class="subSpacer"></div>

            <p>Basic operations lead to learning through the activity,
              but understanding what needs to be done in order to reach success or
              completion is other half of the challenge (Krajcik et al., 1998; National
              Research Council, 1996; Quintana et al., 1999; Reiser et al., 2001). This step
              leans towards being highly critical in ill-structured learning
              environments. Most scientific inquiry lacks prescribed ways of
              navigating problems and solutions (M. Davis, Hawley, McMullan, &amp; Spilka, 1997).
              Students need to be constantly monitoring and understanding their efforts and performance
              for success and meaningful learning to occur.</p>
              <p><strong>Obstacles</strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li>Students need to learn and comprehend the procedures that need to be performed in order to achieve</li>
                <li>Students must come to terms with how to organize their inquiries—the relevant sequence of coordinated action</li>
                <li>Students must position their efforts to achieve the correct result (i.e., avoid getting distracted by less
                  important tasks). Experts often have obtained a high level of automation with such low-order activities,
                  but when unaddressed they can interfere with student learning</li>
              </ol>

            <p>The purpose of the previous two task models were to provide a foundation
              from which a student could then direct their understandings into a meaningful
              conclusion&mdash;or argument. In this final task, a student reviews, reflects,
              evaluates, synthesizes and critiques their thinking in order to articulate
              the learned knowledge. Many of the other educational frameworks also leverage
              articulation and reflection; making thinking visible and life-long learning
              from SKIF, and knowledge refinement and realizing knowledge gaps in LfU. By
              reflecting on the process and sense making tasks, students can improve their
              understandings and inquiry skills, detect weaknesses and strengths, assess goal
              achievement and publicly display their knowledge (Quintana, 2009).</p>
              <p><strong>Obstacles</strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li>Apply knowledge with an intent to reinforce and reorganize an understanding so it is more useful</li>
                <li>Retrospectively reflect on knowledge and experience with an intent to reorganize and reindex an understanding</li>
              </ol>
