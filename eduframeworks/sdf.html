            <p>Scaffolding design framework (SDF) is a comprehensive synthesis of various models
              of science inquiry practice and general learning theory <span class="citation" data-article=16 >[16]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>.
              Among the models condensed into SDF are the LfU and SKIF frameworks. The purpose
              of SDF is as a theoretical framework for inquiry that can be examined empirically
              to highlight what approaches to scaffolding work best for learners across contexts.
              SDF is broken down into three high-level elements: task model, obstacles, and scaffolding
              guidelines <span class="citation" data-article=16 >[16]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>. Task model describes types of inquiry contrived from existing
              literature, obstacles are what learners encounter while using a type of task model, and the
              third element is a collection of scaffolding guidelines that describe how task model types
              can be modified to help learners pass obstacles.</p>
            <img id="header-why-important" class="headerBadges" src="assets/header-why-important.png" alt=""/>
            <p>SDF represents an amalgamation of various inquiry methods and theories of learning. As each
              of the constituent parts address specific concerns and design challenges, an assortment
              of them provides a robust framework to base future learning design on. SDF creates common
              ground for the other frameworks and allows learning contexts to be compared and studied.
              SDF by its nature, is also an attempt to extract the underlying workings from other
              theories and their models of learning. The high-level insight proposed by SDF can
              help guide new theory and development across multiple domains.</p>

            <p>Sense making describes the very nature of how basic actions are done by students
              practicing scientific inquiry: forming hypotheses, designing and carrying out
              experiments, analyzing data, and understanding what was done. The purpose is
              to make sense with the rigor of a scientist—a systematic and operationalized
              activity embodying the rules and regulations of the respective field (e.g.,
              only varying one aspect at a time, testing hypothesis with experimental cases,
              etc.). Through the design of the activity, students learn from the actions and
              sequences they engage with: manipulating representations, elucidating patterns,
              and identifying objects and problems.</p>
              <p><strong>Obstacles</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Learners need help when connecting their existing knowledge to that of the formal discipline <span class="citation" data-article=7 >[7]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span></li>
              <li>Students do not have domain specific knowledge to indentify the most relevant information</li>
              <li>Learning the expert strategies to guide sense making are not typically salient <span class="citation" data-article=3 >[3, <span class="tooltipCite"></span></span><span class="citation" data-article=4 >4, <span class="tooltipCite"></span></span><span class="citation" data-article=12 >12]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span></li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Guidlines</strong></p>
            <img class="guidelines" src="assets/guidelines-1.png" alt=""/>

            <div class="subSpacer"></div>

            <p>Basic operations lead to learning through the activity,
              but understanding what needs to be done in order to reach success or
              completion is the other half of the challenge
              <span class="citation" data-article=8 >[8, <span class="tooltipCite"></span></span><span class="citation" data-article=13 >13, <span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>

              leans towards being highly aware of actions in ill-structured learning
              environments. As most scientific inquiry lacks prescribed ways of
              navigating problems and solutions <span class="citation" data-article=6 >[6]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>,
              students need to be constantly monitoring and understanding their efforts and performance
              for success and meaningful learning to occur.</p>
              <p><strong>Obstacles</strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li>Students need to learn and comprehend the procedures that need to be performed in order to reach achievement</li>
                <li>Students must come to terms with how to organize their inquiries—the relevant sequence of coordinated action</li>
                <li>Students must position their efforts to achieve the correct result (i.e., avoid getting distracted by less
                  important tasks). Experts often have obtained a high level of automation with such low-order activities,
                  but when unaddressed they can interfere with student learning</li>
              </ol>

              <img class="guidelines" src="assets/guidelines-2.png" alt=""/>

            <p>The purpose of the previous two task models were to provide a foundation
              from which a student could then direct their understandings into a meaningful
              conclusion&mdash;or argument. In this final task, a student reviews, reflects,
              evaluates, synthesizes and critiques their thinking in order to articulate
              the learned knowledge. Many of the other educational frameworks also leverage
              articulation and reflection: making thinking visible and life-long learning
              from SKIF, and knowledge refinement and realization of knowledge gaps in LfU. By
              reflecting on the process and sense making tasks, students can improve their
              understandings and inquiry skills, detect weaknesses and strengths, assess goal
              achievement, and publicly display their knowledge <span class="citation" data-article=16 >[16]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>.</p>
              <p><strong>Obstacles</strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li>Students do not typically reflect productively or realize that they should articulate their knowledge

                <li>Students may use self-harming strategies (e.g., quick outcomes to save own time; <span class="citation" data-article=22 >[22]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>) and may not fully identify and reconcile discrepancies in their knowledge <span class="citation" data-article=2 >[2, <span class="tooltipCite"></span></span><span class="citation" data-article=26 >26]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span></li>
                <li>Learners do not explore all of their options, at times succumbing to logistical details <span class="citation" data-article=21 >[21]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>, and can fail to understand how to effectively measure their progress
                  <span class="citation" data-article=9 >[9, <span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>
                  <span class="citation" data-article=14 >14, <span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>

                <li>Students lack the existing knowledge to successfully package up the critical scientific products: supporting claims with evidence, warranting arguments <span class="citation" data-article=24 >[24]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>,
                  refining and expanding explanations <span class="citation" data-article=1 >[1]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>, and composing coherent claims and handling multiple reasonings <span class="citation" data-article=18 >[18]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span></li>

              <p>Learning for a student should be matched to what using and applying that knowledge actually means.
              So learning chemistry only on paper without even knowing how a chemist does their profession does
            not help a student learn how to do chemistry&mdash;they are learning how solve decontextualized problems. By using
          chemistry equipment and doing science as it is done professionally grounds the learning in a meaninful context.</p>
              <img class="storyImage" src="assets/sdf-sense.png" alt="" />
              <p>When learning in such a setting, the experience may be very dynamic and a student may struggle to understand
              how to effectively apply their knowledge, or fail to develop a robust foundation. An example of this failure can be demonstrated by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tropico+5&espv=2&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwib7aeli57TAhXmwlQKHV4dAUwQ_AUICSgE&biw=918&bih=850" target="_blank">Tropico 5</a>,
              a city building simulator where you build farms, design the ruling government, and deal with disasters and public issues as your city grows. However, when learning the system
              and trying to understand what is happening, your town can be burning down right in front of your eyes with no clue what's causing it. Students need
            ways to refine how they interact with a system, and see how their choices influence outcomes while they learn.</p>
              <img class="storyImage" src="assets/sdf-process.png" alt="" />
              <p>Understanding the process is one thing, but to improve that process is what learning is all about. How
              does the novice become an expert? With the right structure, students can transition to a professional status as their actions and learnings approach those
            of the experts their learning is based on.</p>
