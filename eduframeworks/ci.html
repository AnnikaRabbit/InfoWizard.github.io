            <p>Cooperative inquiry is not a learning framework, rather it is a design framework
              related to methodologies like cooperative design, participatory design, contextual
              inquiry, activity theory, and situated action <span class="citation" data-article=2 >[2]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>. Cooperative inquiry
              sets itself apart from the other methods by (1) forming multidisciplinary partnerships
              with children, (2) focus on understanding context, activities and artifacts, and (3)
              iterative design of low- and high-tech prototypes. The goal is to go into an educational
              space and understand how it operates. In such spaces, there is a plethora of complex
              interactions that can run in parallel, require dynamic collaboration, and simply
              dispose of the assumed sequential order it was intended to take. Furthermore, many
              other design frameworks do not address differences between working with adult partners
              or child partners, hence this work begins to document how children function in such a
              role and how the end product can benefit from the children's perspectives <span class="citation" data-article=2 >[2]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>.</p>

            <p>When designing a technology, having users partner with a research team's efforts helps
              guide and direct the development as to meet the needs of actual use. This
              concept has been increasingly used in many disciplines across the globe and stated
              concretely, <em>“We see the need for users to become full partners in the cooperative
                system development process ... . Full participation of (users) requires training and
                active cooperation, not just token representation.”</em> <span class="citation" data-article=3 >[3]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>.
                This means that researchers, through partnership with users, observe and analyze the
                full breadth of an experience: activity patterns, communications, artifacts, and
                cultural relationships <span class="citation" data-article=2 >[2]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>. It is this relationship, between the designer
                and the user, that helps make sense of a dynamic and “messy” environment. The dual
                effort leads to the creation of diagrams and models for understanding the core experience, and
                storyboards and prototypes for testing new ideas. By combining all of this information a more useful technology is produced&mdash;cooperative inquiry.</p>

            <p>Based on Beyer and Holtzblatt <span class="citation" data-article=1 >[1]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span> work, development research needs to be done in the
              user's own environment. Taking Beyer and Holtsblatt work further, this form of
              contextual inquiry consists of adult and child researchers. Both of whom observe,
              gather data, take notes, and work with other children users. Having users take
              on the role of researcher is a prime distinction between this and other models of
              contextual inquiry.</p>

              <p><strong>Research role: Adult</strong></p>
              <p><em>Note Taking</em></p>
              <p class="additionalParagraph">In pairs, one adult records the activities of children
                while the other focuses on the dialogue. Time is noted for entries so the data can be
                synchronized. In addition to the note-takers, another adult (“the interactor”) would
                initiate discussion and ask questions about what the children were doing, or to ask
                about things they interacted with. However, it is more important for the interactor to
                become a part of the activity and to vocalize what is going on rather than disrupt the
                natural flow of the children's activity. The interactor also helped children feel more
                comfortable, rather than being silently observed (i.e., the children didn't feel as if they were “on stage”;
                <span class="citation" data-article=2 >[2]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>).</p>
              <p><em>Visualizing Data</em></p>
              <p class="additionalParagraph">Diagrams of the notes were constructed to understand the
                children's patterns of activity and roles played. The notes consisted of time,
                quotes, activities, activity pattern, roles and design ideas. The first set of
                columns on the left are the raw data from the adults. In the columns to the right,
                activity patterns and roles are developed through grounded theory, and are based on the raw data columns.
                The final column is for design ideas, which is meant to start the process of idea generation and development.</p>

              <p><strong>Research role: Children</strong></p>
              <p><em>Note Taking</em></p>
              <p class="additionalParagraph">The children's notes often combine drawings with text to create
                cartoon-like summaries <span class="citation" data-article=2 >[2]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>. Once adult notes have been collected, they are compared
                and matched with child notes; sections of overlap are highlighted in order to capture the differing or similar
                perspectives. Many times over, the child summaries helped the adult partners see something they missed
                <span class="citation" data-article=2 >[2]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>.</p>

            <img class="subHeaderBadges" src="assets/subheader-ci-2.png" alt=""/>
            <div class="subSpacer"></div>
            <p>Children and adults work together to make design decisions and create
              low-tech prototypes. This is sometimes a difficult balance and one must
              be mindful of over-leading and power dynamics. However, with a little team
              management, the research partners can use a selection of tools to build and
              test ideas based on the contextual inquiry. The selection of tools matters:
              they should try to relate to the end product as well as be usable and familiar
              to the researchers. A mismatch in prototyping tools can result in confusion or
              frustration while the adults and children try to make the prototypes engaging and feel quality.</p>

            <div class="subSpacer"></div>
            <p>In order to understand what children truly gravitate to, and what they
              decide to use in an environment, give them a place to do just that. By having an area that
              is rich in technology with many choices, children can have meaningful
              experiences and adults can learn how children think and act when given
              control and autonomy. CHIkids is one such event that occurs over five
              days and gives a group of children hours to become fully immersed as digital
              storytellers, tech testers, and more <span class="citation" data-article=2 >[2]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>. Children not only can
              talk about their experiences, but can demonstrate with their behavior and
              time spent how technology impacts them and what they want in technology.</p>

              <div class="subSpacer"></div>
              <p>Learning through the process of design itself is a critical reason to participate
                in cooperative inquiry. This type of learning has been referenced to as a community
                of practice, where there is a mixture of skills and shared goals <span class="citation" data-article=4 >[4]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>.
                Domains that have been taught are: understanding design process, intergenerational
                teamwork, communication and collaboration skills, developing technical skills (e.g.,
                building and making technology), and content knowledge involving the research. While
                the research is not purposely design to target learning outcomes, the involved and
                engaging processes often connect participants in similar ways as a learning framework might.</p>
