            <p>Scaffolded knowledge integration framework (SKIF) is an educational design resulting from the synthesis of
              curricula programs (i.e., Computer as Learning Partner) developed for thermodynamics (Linn, 2000). In SKIF,
              students use the methods to link, connect, and integrate their understandings about a domain into a cohesive
              basis. From this unified base, students can apply their understandings to problems that are meaningful to
              them. The drive for SKIF is enabling students to examine new knowledge from their own perspective and
              conceptual framework, rather than adopt a view from the instructor (Linn, 2000). From this student-centric
              level of progression, SKIF sees student knowledge as building blocks and encourages students to resolve
              discrepancies over memorizing facts and events.</p>
            <img id="header-why-important" class="headerBadges" src="assets/header-why-important.png" alt=""/>
            <p>Students enter into novel learning environments with some foundation to think from. Students
              have complex knowledge about models (e.g., heuristics, algorithms, representations, mechanisms,
              etc.) and need to consider how to expand, compare, ameliorate, define, integrate, and connect
              new information into their existing perspectives (Linn et al., 1994, Linn, 2000). In order to
              help students, whom are novices in a subject matter, SKIF is designed to facilitate the process
              where students improve upon the sophistication of knowledge models as well as distinguish among them.</p>
            <p class="additionalParagraph">The intent of this framework is not necessarily about the progression
              from novice to expert, rather it is about providing students with a strong foundation for future
              learning. Students will have a wide repertoire of models, rather than focusing on a single
              “correct” model or replacing models. This attitude toward learning can help prepare students
              to act as informed citizens (Linn, 2000).</p>

            <div class="subSpacer"></div>
            <p>Beginning with existing ideas, students can build and integrate new knowledge that
              connects to what they already know. The accessibility can be met through scaffolding
              that builds up student understandings, or may bring in students' outside-of-school interests.
              An undertone of this framework is to connect the new models and knowledge to everyday life.
              In this perspective, what should be learned is how we use science in daily life rather
              than generate a new kind “school only science.” By making this connection to the personal,
              the content to be learned switches from being driven by expert and abstract framing, which
              encourages memorization and isolation of new information, to being a meaningful experience
              that registers with existing ideas (Linn &amp; Hsi, 2000).</p>
            <p class="additionalParagraph">However, this does not mean that the learning should be
              something that is easy or comfortable to the student. Rather, the goal should be to
              base the learning on student knowledge, but then to provide an engaging amount of
              difficulty so the student can develop new models and understanding to explain the
              discrepancy between what they know and the new knowledge.</p>

            <img class="subHeaderBadges" src="assets/subheader-skif-2.png" alt=""/>
            <div class="subSpacer"></div>
            <p>Students have many models of knowledge, and as they negotiate the differences
              between their existing knowledge and the new content, the need ways to evaluate
              the evidence of their thinking. The balance between becoming aware of one's
              thinking and having the teacher (or content) direct responsibility is delicate.
              Too little scaffolding or missing skills may hinder knowledge integration as a
              student struggles to exercise self-learning (e.g., Duschl, 1990; Raizen, 1991),
              but by making thinking too visible and explicit encourages memorization over
              understanding (Linn, 2000).</p>
              <p class="additionalParagraph">The intent of making thinking visible is to
                have reflection and activities that initiate an understanding of what has
                been done—exploring the hows and whys. Such skills can be developed through
                acting as investigators to critique and evaluate evidence, reflecting on
                alternative explanations and situations, reflecting on how ideas change and
                develop, modeling dynamic systems, comparing expert-to-novice pathways, and
                engaging in continuous reasoning for develop an area expertise (Linn, 2000).</p>

            <img class="subHeaderBadges" src="assets/subheader-skif-3.png" alt=""/>
            <div class="subSpacer"></div>
            <p>Learning, philosophers and educations have asserted, is a social medium (
              e.g., Dewey, 1901; Dewey, 1929). Whether from Vygotsky's (1978) “zone of proximal development”
              or from communities of learners (Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter, 1993), groups of students
              can leverage distributed knowledge to overcome challenges and support fellow
              learning. This can result in novice students learning expert behavior from more
              skilled students&mdash;communities of practice (Brown &amp; Campione, 1990; Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991;
              Newman et al., 1989; Pea, 1992). The balance for social inclusion is delicate as well.</p>
              <p class="additionalParagraph">Groups sizes of 3-4 can initiate exclusion due to
                limited workspace, gender can develop into power dynamics, leaders can gain the
                most experience, and work can be distributed rather than collaborative,
                meaning that students work alone and combine results (Burbules &amp; Linn, 1991;
                Madhok, 1992 April 4 &amp; 5). In order for peer support to be most effective,
                the activity needs to help students build and integrate knowledge together.
                Smaller groups can help when designing activities so that the work students
                do relies on joint action in learning (Linn, 1992b).</p>

              <img class="subHeaderBadges" src="assets/subheader-skif-4.png" alt=""/>
              <div class="subSpacer"></div>
              <p>How students learn in school shouldn't be an exception from learning
                in life. Students should resonate with what they are learning about,
                as well as how they are learning the content. The approaches used
                during learning and the repertoire of models can designed to be reusable
                and have utility in life. The common properties of inquiry (e.g.,
                critiquing perspectives, planning experiments, testing ideas, and
                evaluating models) can give a student a strong general ability at inquiry (Linn, 2004).</p>
                <p class="additionalParagraph">The development and recognition of these life-long
                  utility skills leads students being autonomous learners&mdash;they become natural
                  learners. While going through a SKIF experience, students
                  should be encouraged to find and reflect on their knowledge models a
                  nd evaluate their success in overcoming challenges. Other
                  things like receiving feedback, writing summaries, making outlines,
                  generating questions, and reflecting can help increase the quality
                  of the learned knowledge (Linn, 2004). Revisiting knowledge (either simply,
                  or from a more challenging perspective) can also help mimic life-long learning,
                  with the additional benefit that retrieving information impacts knowledge
                  utility more than traditionally studying the same content (Bjork, 1994).</p>
                  <p class="additionalParagraph">Apart from operational and in-line strategies,
                    a final design can be to rely on sustained reasoning (i.e., one central topic
                    to a high degree). With a central area of focus, students can develop a powerful
                    base of information that helps them bridge to new ideas. Having deep experience
                    in one domain lets students begin to organize knowledge and develop nuances of
                    connected situations—making a solid base for future learning (Linn, 2004).</p>
