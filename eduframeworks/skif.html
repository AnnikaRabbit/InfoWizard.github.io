            <p>Scaffolded knowledge integration framework (SKIF) is an educational framework resulting from the synthesis of
              curricula programs (e.g., Computer as Learning Partner) and is designed to support learning thermodynamics <span class="citation" data-article=9 >[9]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>. In SKIF,
              students learn to link, connect, and integrate their understandings about a domain into a cohesive
              basis. From this unified base, students can apply their understandings to problems that are meaningful to
              them. The drive for SKIF is enabling students to examine new knowledge from their own perspective and
              conceptual framework, rather than adopt a view from the instructor <span class="citation" data-article=9 >[9]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>. From this student-centric
              level of progression, SKIF sees student knowledge as building blocks and encourages students to resolve
              discrepancies over memorizing facts and events.</p>
            <img id="header-why-important" class="headerBadges" src="assets/header-why-important.png" alt=""/>
            <p>Students enter into novel learning environments with some preexisting foundation to think from. Students
              have complex knowledge about models (e.g., heuristics, algorithms, representations, mechanisms,
              etc.) and need to consider how to expand, compare, ameliorate, define, integrate, and connect
              new information into their existing perspectives
              <span class="citation" data-article=11 >[11, <span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>
              <span class="citation" data-article=9 >9]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>.
              In order to help students, whom are novices in a subject matter, SKIF is designed to facilitate the process
              where students improve their sophistication of knowledge models as well as distinguish among them.</p>
            <p class="additionalParagraph">The intent of this framework is not necessarily about the progression
              from novice to expert, rather it is about providing students with a strong foundation for future
              learning. Students will have a wide repertoire of models, rather than focusing on a single
              “correct” model or replacing models. An underlying goal of SKIF is that attitude toward learning can help prepare students
              to act as informed citizens <span class="citation" data-article=9 >[9]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>.</p>

            <img id="header-how-used" class="headerBadges" src="assets/header-how-used.png" alt=""/>
            <img class="subHeaderBadges" src="assets/subheader-skif-1.png" alt=""/>
            <div class="subSpacer"></div>
            <p>Beginning with existing ideas, students need to build and integrate new knowledge that
              connects to what they already know. Accessibility can be met through scaffolding
              that builds up student understandings, or may bring in students' outside-of-school interests.
              An undertone of this framework is to connect the new models and knowledge to everyday life.
              In this perspective, what should be learned is how we use science in daily life rather
              than generating a new kind of “school only science.” By making this connection to the personal,
              the content to be learned switches from being driven by expert and abstract framing, which
              encourages memorization and isolation of new information, to being a meaningful experience
              that registers with existing ideas <span class="citation" data-article=12 >[12]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>.</p>
            <p class="additionalParagraph">However, this does not mean that the learning should be
              something that is easy or comfortable to the student. The goal should be to
              base the learning on student knowledge and provide an engaging amount of
              difficulty. From this experience, a student can develop new models and understanding by overcoming the
              discrepancy between what they know and the new knowledge.</p>

            <img class="subHeaderBadges" src="assets/subheader-skif-2.png" alt=""/>
            <div class="subSpacer"></div>
            <p>Students have many models of knowledge, and as they negotiate the differences
              between their existing knowledge and the new content, they need ways to evaluate
              the evidence of their thinking. The balance between becoming aware of one's
              thinking and having the teacher (or content) direct responsibility is delicate.
              Too little scaffolding or reduced awareness may hinder knowledge integration as a
              student struggles to exercise self-learning (e.g., <span class="citation" data-article=6 >[6, <span class="tooltipCite"></span></span><span class="citation" data-article=17 >17]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>),
              but by making thinking too visible and explicit encourages memorization over
              understanding <span class="citation" data-article=9 >[9]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>.</p>
              <p class="additionalParagraph">The key to making thinking visible is to
                have reflection and activities that initiate an understanding of what has
                been done—exploring the hows and whys. Such skills can be developed by:
                acting as investigators to critique and evaluate evidence, reflecting on
                alternative explanations and situations, reflecting on how ideas change and
                develop, modeling dynamic systems, comparing expert-to-novice pathways, and
                engaging in continuous reasoning for developing an area of expertise <span class="citation" data-article=9 >[9]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>.</p>

            <img class="subHeaderBadges" src="assets/subheader-skif-3.png" alt=""/>
            <div class="subSpacer"></div>
            <p>Learning&mdash;philosophers and educations have long asserted&mdash;is a social medium (e.g., <span class="citation" data-article=4 >[4, <span class="tooltipCite"></span></span><span class="citation" data-article=5 >5]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>). Whether from Vygotsky's <span class="citation" data-article=19 >[19]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span> “zone of proximal development”
              or from communities of learners <span class="citation" data-article=1 >[1]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>, groups of students
              can leverage distributed knowledge to overcome challenges and support fellow
              learning. A prime example may be when a novice student learns expert behavior from more
              skilled students&mdash;communities of practice <span class="citation" data-article=14 >[14, <span class="tooltipCite"></span></span><span class="citation" data-article=7 >7, <span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>
              <span class="citation" data-article=15 >15, <span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>
               <span class="citation" data-article=18 >18]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>. The balance for social inclusion is delicate as well.</p>
              <p class="additionalParagraph">Group sizes of 3-4+ can begin to affect participation due to
                limited workspace, gender differences can develop into power dynamics, leaders can gain the
                most beneficial experience, and work can be distributed rather than collaborative (i.e., students work alone and combine results) <span class="citation" data-article=3 >[3, <span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>
                <span class="citation" data-article=13 >13]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>. In order for peer support to be most effective,
                the designed activity needs to help students build and integrate knowledge cohesively.
                Also, smaller groups can help when in activities so that the work students
                accomplish relies on joint action in learning <span class="citation" data-article=8 >[8]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>.</p>

              <img class="subHeaderBadges" src="assets/subheader-skif-4.png" alt=""/>
              <div class="subSpacer"></div>
              <p>How students learn in school shouldn't be an exception from learning
                in life. Students should resonate with what they are learning about,
                as well as how they are learning the content. The approaches used
                during learning and the repertoire of models can be designed to be reusable
                and have utility in life. The common properties of inquiry (e.g.,
                critiquing perspectives, planning experiments, testing ideas, and
                evaluating models) can give a student a strong general ability at inquiry <span class="citation" data-article=10 >[10]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>.</p>
                <p class="additionalParagraph">The development and recognition of these life-long
                  utility skills leads students to becoming autonomous learners&mdash;they become natural
                  learners. While going through a SKIF experience, students
                  should be encouraged to find and reflect on their knowledge models and evaluate their success in overcoming challenges. Other
                  things like receiving feedback, writing summaries, making outlines,
                  generating questions, and reflecting can help increase the quality
                  of the learned knowledge <span class="citation" data-article=10 >[10]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>. Additionally, revisiting knowledge (either simply,
                  or from a more challenging perspective) can also help mimic life-long learning.
                  However, when there is a new perspective taken, the challenge comes with the additional benefit that retrieving information impacts knowledge
                  usefulness more than traditionally studying the same content <span class="citation" data-article=2 >[2]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>.</p>
                  <p class="additionalParagraph">Apart from operational and in-line strategies,
                    a final design can be to rely on sustained reasoning (i.e., studying one central topic
                    to a high degree). With a central area of focus, students can develop a powerful
                    base of information that helps them bridge to new ideas. Having deep experience
                    in one domain lets students begin to organize knowledge and develop nuances of
                    connected situations—making a solid base for future learning <span class="citation" data-article=10 >[10]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>.</p>

                    <p>Learning in the class can be more than just passing a test, but can develop skills that are already
                    known or familiar to the student. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=lego+mindstorms&espv=2&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiJmc7Y6p3TAhUUImMKHaEPByQQ_AUICCgD&biw=965&bih=897" targer="_blank">Lego Mindstorms</a>
                  are one way that students can feel like their personal interests matter, and that learning in school can
                be relevant to them. The vehicle below is one such example a student could make. This vehicle shakes and vibrates, and is controlled by programming code
              also written by the student.</p>
                    <img class="storyImage" src="assets/skif-access.png" alt="" />
                    <p>Being aware of what is going on and why it is happening helps contextualize what needs to be learned.
                    Programming the robotic vehicle puts the learning outcomes into a visual medium. The programming software
                  also likely helps students understand how to get the robot to perform actions. Beyond how the robot helps
                students see what is going on, the learning setting should be designed to help students reflect on and test multiple
              ways to do things. For example, being able to see and understand what other students made, and how their design is different.</p>
                    <img class="storyImage" src="assets/skif-visible.png" alt="" />
                    <p>Learning in a vaccuum inhales immensely. Students should be building off each other's ideas and helping to solve problems. This is also a chance
                      that students can explain what they know, and collaboratively build knowledge. For example, another student may
                      suggest to the creator of the walker robot above that flat discs on its feet may improve stability. This kind of experience
                      can benefit both students learning outcomes and engagement.</p>
                    <img class="storyImage" src="assets/skif-others.png" alt="" />
                    <p>When one connects learning experiences in this way, they are not learning to jump through hoops
                    but are becoming a life-long learner. Gaining new knowledge is a journey&mdash;not a series of obstacles&mdash;the
                  student can take what they learn forward and become a "grown" learner.</p>
