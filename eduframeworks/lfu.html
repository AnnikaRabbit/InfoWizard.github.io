            <p>Learning for use (LfU) is an educational framework&mdash;originating from national science curriculum&mdash;that
              helps students develop deep, interconnected knowledge and inquiry skills <span class="citation" data-article=4 >[4]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>. The impetus for LfU stems
              from how traditional didactic lecture, readings, problems and separate laboratory experiments lead to students
              being unable to use their knowledge robustly <span class="citation" data-article=9 >[9]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>.
              The foundation of LfU is designed as a general model of
              learning, but has historically been organized around an inquiry-based pedagogy to coordinate content and process while learning science.</p>
            <img id="header-why-important" class="headerBadges" src="assets/header-why-important.png" alt=""/>
            <p>When students learn something new, they take information and create some form of knowledge structure,
              connecting it to what is already known. In order to create a complex interconnected web of knowledge,
              a student cannot rely on simple exposure to content and cannot receive information through some direct
              transmission. The act of building an understanding happens step-by-step as a student makes sense of an
              experience and interacts with their learning. Developing knowledge in this way is critical, as it leads
              to strong contextual cues during learning—improving retrieval for robust usage
              <span class="citation" data-article=3 >[3, <span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>
              <span class="citation" data-article=5 >5, <span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>
              <span class="citation" data-article=7 >7, <span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>
              <span class="citation" data-article=8 >8]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span></p>
            <p class="additionalParagraph">Beyond having a capability to recall knowledge structures, students must also be able to use their
              conceptual knowledge. If a student is unable to operationalize what they have learned, the recalled
              knowledge is still problematically impotent <span class="citation" data-article=4 >[4]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>. LfU addresses how to provide a deep and
              richly connected context at the same time as giving a student useful experiences in applying that knowledge.</p>

            <p>An activity can make the learner realize there is a need for new knowledge. This can be a
              self-aware realization or one which occurs subconsciously, but is contrived through some limitation
              or gap in knowledge
              <span class="citation" data-article=2 >[2, <span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>
              <span class="citation" data-article=7 >7]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>.
              Schank <span class="citation" data-article=7 >[7]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>, reads that when a student hits
              such a limit or barrier, it creates a motivating desire to acquire new information and also helps
              contextually to incorporate new knowledge. The former establishes a goal to achieve, the latter
              address the incremental nature of knowledge construction. There are two ways to design an activity
              to leverage this component:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create an activity where students must apply the missing knowledge in order to succeed</li>
              <li>Reveal a gap in the students knowledge and elicit curiosity about their current understanding</li>
            </ul>

            <img class="subHeaderBadges" src="assets/subheader-construct.png" alt=""/>
            <div class="subSpacer"></div>
            <p>The most fundamental process in LfU, a student needs to incrementally construct new knowledge
              and link it with their existing understanding (Edelson, 2001). New knowledge comes in the way
              of direct experiences with new concepts, examining old ones, or making connections between any
              combination of old and new. The intent is to make sure that students can observe and understand
              the relationships of the to be learned content, and ameliorate their current knowledge.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Experiences in constructing new knowledge can be founded on either firsthand experience, communication with others, or both.</li>
              </ul>
            <img class="subHeaderBadges" src="assets/subheader-refine.png" alt=""/>
            <div class="subSpacer"></div>
            <p>In order to maximize the usefulness of knowledge, students need to (1) reorganize their declarative
              knowledge of facts and events into procedural knowledge of knowing how to do things <span class="citation" data-article=1 >[1]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>
              and (2) make connections between the new knowledge and what situations it can be used in
              <span class="citation" data-article=5 >[5, <span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>
              <span class="citation" data-article=6 >6, <span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>
              <span class="citation" data-article=7 >7, <span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>
              <span class="citation" data-article=8 >8]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>
              Two ways to address the refinement of knowledge:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Apply knowledge with an intent to reinforce and reorganize an understanding so it is more useful</li>
                <li>Retrospectively reflect on knowledge and experience with an intent to reorganize and reindex an understanding</li>
              </ul>
