            <p>Anchored instruction, a form of situated learning, uses realistic problem spaces and
              integrates what students need to do with how professionals and experts would perform
              when faced with the same dilemma. Students are presented macro-contexts from which all
              of their learning and instruction will be based around (i.e., the macro-context is an
              anchor of their experience). The design of the anchors are important, as they will
              influence the interest and active construction of knowledge <span class="citation" data-article=2 >[2]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>. The anchors
              can be thought of generators, in that rather than lecture students about a setting or
              reflect some billboard of context, the anchors themselves are stories that learners can
              explore and interact with. Supporting the richly anchored narrative, the problems and
              activities in these macro-contexts are authentic and rely on real data for their difficulty
              and intrigue—which require authentic action to solve. </p>

            <p>Students are incredibly adept at detecting when you want them to do something for the sake of
              doing it (i.e., an unmotivated action). The intent is to leverage the rich experience of
              finding and acting through a realistic role, and then solve meaningful problems connected to
              that role. The knowledge that students can develop in these rich problem spaces are meaningful
              to a real context, there is a purpose to what they are learning and doing. Beyond the
              real-world connection, anchored instruction strings together activities of growing complexity
              while maintaining a common story. This binding thread gives students a familiar foundation to
              relate their ideas within and between different problems in the space. This design helps
              learners move from being a novice learner to being able to gain an understanding of how to
              generate, define and achieve complex goals <span class="citation" data-article=1 >[1]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>.</p>

            <div class="subSpacer"></div>
            <p>Building a realistic narrative sets the rules and behaviors that students should
              focus on emulating. Often, a video-based format can help bridge a student's imagination
              to becoming a member of this world. The intent of the video narrative is not to
              provide lecture based information, rather it is to introduce a problem and frame
              its realness for students.</p>

            <img class="subHeaderBadges" src="assets/subheader-ai-2.png" alt=""/>
            <div class="subSpacer"></div>
            <p>The challenge posed by the world component should be presented in a
              generative format. Students are given a goal, but then need to identify
              the ways in which they will accomplish that goal, hence generating the
              problems they will need to solve. Part of anchored instruction is to
              compare how students think about achieving the goal and understand the
              connections and relationships between the problems they choose. The setup
              of the problem gives a deep richness to the variables of interest, and as
              students test and solve problems, they can begin to identify strengths and
              weaknesses in their understandings <span class="citation" data-article=1 >[1]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>.</p>

            <div class="subSpacer"></div>
            <p>After students work through the main problem, follow-up questions and
              situations can be designed that recombine parts of the base problem
              in order to form new problems with a familiar context. In such questions,
              a single variable could change, which forces the student to reassess their
              existing knowledge—can I use the same solution and why or why not? Beyond
              creating new problems based on the anchored context, students can take part
              in making new stories for themselves or others. This further increases students'
              understandings of the domain.</p>

              <img class="subHeaderBadges" src="assets/subheader-ai-4.png" alt=""/>
              <div class="subSpacer"></div>
              <p>After the main problem has been solved, students can work on extension
                problems to test their understandings and make their knowledge flexible.
                These problems do not have to occur in the main anchored context, and
                can there for bridge to general principles of learning domains (e.g,
                mathematics, history, writing, etc.).</p>

                <img class="subHeaderBadges" src="assets/subheader-ai-5.png" alt=""/>
                <div class="subSpacer"></div>
                <p>The importance of connection from the anchored instruction to the real world
                  makes a huge difference for students. When their learning can extend to people
                  doing things in real life, their motivation to continue learning is fueled.
                  This can take learning about planning a rescue mission of an animal using a
                  plane to studying flight plans of Charles Lindbergh or understanding plans to
                  reach the moon <span class="citation" data-article=1 >[1]<span class="tooltipCite"></span></span>. Other avenues could start in learning about solar
                  power and connect to examples like Elon Musk and Tesla. The value of the anchored
                  instruction mentality engages students in problem posing, which can lead to them
                  connecting what they are learning to future and life long learning.</p>
